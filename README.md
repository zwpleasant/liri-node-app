LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node application that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Instructions
Save the GitHub repository onto your local computer. Pull up your command line interface and navigate to the folder where you saved the repository. Before using, type "npm install" to install the packages into your repository that you will need to run LIRI. To run LIRI, each time type in "node" and "liri.js", then input a command for LIRI to interpret. To pull up the last 20 tweets from an account, simply type in the command "my-tweets". To search for a song on the Spotify Web API, type in "spotify-this-song" and then the title of the song. To search for a movie through the OMDb API, type in "movie-this" and then the title of the movie. To run the "do-what-it-says" command. Simply navigate to the random.txt file and populate it with one of the three commands, and the input you're looking for.
